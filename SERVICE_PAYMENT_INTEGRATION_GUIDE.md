# Service Payment Integration Guide

This guide explains how the HDFC SmartGateway payment system is integrated with your service request functionality.

## üéØ **How It Works**

### For Students Requesting Services:

1. **Service Selection**: Student selects a service from the dropdown
2. **Payment Method Check**: System checks if service requires payment
3. **Payment Flow**: 
   - **Free Services**: Direct service request submission
   - **Postpaid Services**: Service request submitted, payment required after approval
   - **Prepaid Services**: Payment required before service request creation

### Payment Flow for Prepaid Services:

```
Student Portal (/student)
     ‚Üì
Select Prepaid Service
     ‚Üì
Click "Proceed to Payment"
     ‚Üì
HDFC Payment Gateway
     ‚Üì
Payment Success Page
     ‚Üì
Auto-create Service Request
     ‚Üì
Back to Student Portal
```

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### 1. Service Types

Services have a `payment_method` field with these values:
- **`free`**: No payment required
- **`prepaid`**: Payment required before processing
- **`postpaid`**: Payment required after approval

### 2. Student Portal Changes (`app/student/page.tsx`)

#### Payment Detection:
```typescript
{selectedService?.payment_method === 'prepaid' ? (
  // Show payment button
) : (
  // Show regular submit button
)}
```

#### Payment Handler:
```typescript
const handlePaymentSubmit = async () => {
  // Create payment session
  // Store service request data in localStorage
  // Redirect to HDFC gateway
}
```

### 3. Payment Success Integration

#### Components Created:
- **`PaymentSuccessHandler`**: Handles service request creation after payment
- **API Route**: `/api/payment/complete-service-request`

#### Flow:
1. Payment completes successfully
2. User redirected to `/payment/success`
3. `PaymentSuccessHandler` checks localStorage for pending service request
4. Creates service request via API
5. Shows success/error feedback

### 4. Data Flow

#### Before Payment:
```javascript
// Stored in localStorage
{
  selectedServiceId: "service-123",
  selectedCategoryId: "category-456", 
  notes: "Student notes",
  orderId: "ORD1703123456789"
}
```

#### After Payment:
```javascript
// API call to create service request
{
  selectedServiceId: "service-123",
  userId: "user-789",
  notes: "Student notes",
  orderId: "ORD1703123456789"
}
```

## üé® **UI/UX Features**

### 1. Payment Information Display
- **Payment badge**: Shows payment type (prepaid/postpaid)
- **Payment details box**: Shows amount and security info
- **Clear visual distinction**: Different buttons for payment vs. submission

### 2. Payment Button
- **Blue styling**: Distinguishes from regular submit button
- **Loading state**: Shows payment processing
- **Icon**: Credit card icon for visual clarity

### 3. Success Page Enhancement
- **Service request status**: Shows creation progress
- **Error handling**: Clear feedback if service request fails
- **Navigation**: Direct link back to student portal

## üí∞ **Payment Configuration**

### Current Setup:
```typescript
const paymentData = {
  amount: 100, // ‚Çπ100 standard fee
  customerName: user.user_metadata?.full_name || user.email || 'Student',
  customerEmail: user.email || '',
  customerPhone: user.user_metadata?.phone || '+91 9876543210',
  description: `Payment for ${selectedService.name} service request`
}
```

### Customization Options:

1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Add price field to Service model
2. **Service-specific Amounts**: Different amounts per service
3. **User-specific Pricing**: Student vs. staff pricing

## üõ†Ô∏è **Files Modified/Created**

### Modified Files:
- **`app/student/page.tsx`**: Added payment detection and handling

### New Files:
- **`components/payments/payment-success-handler.tsx`**: Service request creation after payment
- **`app/api/payment/complete-service-request/route.ts`**: API for post-payment service creation

## üîí **Security Features**

1. **Order ID Verification**: Matches payment order with service request
2. **User Authentication**: Verifies user before creating service request
3. **Data Cleanup**: Removes localStorage data after use
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with clear messaging
