# 🚀 Quick Payment Setup Guide

## ❌ Error Fixed: "Missing HDFC configuration"

The payment integration now works in **Test Mode** even without HDFC credentials!

## ✅ **Immediate Solution (Test Mode)**

The payment system will automatically use **Mock Mode** when HDFC credentials are missing. This allows you to:
- ✅ Test the complete payment flow
- ✅ See the payment UI and buttons
- ✅ Experience the full user journey
- ✅ Create service requests after "payment"

## 🧪 **How to Test Right Now**

1. **Go to Student Portal**: `localhost:3000/student`
2. **Select a prepaid service** (TC certificate)
3. **Click "Proceed to Payment"** - you'll see the blue payment button
4. **Mock Payment Gateway** will open
5. **Click "✅ Simulate Successful Payment"**
6. **Service request** will be created automatically
7. **Return to student portal** to see your request

## 🔧 **For Production (Optional)**

When you get real HDFC credentials, create `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Real HDFC Credentials (when available)
HDFC_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
HDFC_MERCHANT_ID=your_real_merchant_id
HDFC_RESPONSE_KEY=your_real_response_key
HDFC_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
